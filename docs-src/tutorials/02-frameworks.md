Due to the fact that AdminBro has modular structure, it can be plugged into any http Node.js framework. We already wrote a couple of plugins that allow pluggin AdminBro into an Express.js and Hapi.js frameworks

## Express.js

- Framework: [https://expressjs.com/](https://expressjs.com/)
- Plugin: [https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro-expressjs](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro-expressjs)

Express.js is one of the most popular Node.js frameworks. To connect it to AdminBro, you have to generate an Express Router by using one of the methods provided by the plugin.

You can find a detailed documentation here: {@link module:admin-bro-expressjs}

## Hapi.js

- Framework: [https://hapijs.com/](https://hapijs.com/)
- Plugin: [https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro-hapijs](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro-hapijs)

You can find a detailed documentation here: {@link module:admin-bro-hapijs}
