Due to the fact that AdminBro has modular structure it can be plugged into any http nodejs framework. We already wrote couple of plugins which allows to plug admin into an Express and Hapi frameworks

## Express

- Framework: [https://expressjs.com/](https://expressjs.com/)
- Plugin: [https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro-expressjs](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro-expressjs)

Expressjs is one of the most popular nodejs frameworks. To connect it to AdminBro you have to generate an Express Router by using one of the methods provided by the plugin.

You can find detailed documentation here: {@link module:admin-bro-expressjs}

## Hapi

- Framework: [https://hapijs.com/](https://hapijs.com/)
- Plugin: [https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro-hapijs](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro-hapijs)
